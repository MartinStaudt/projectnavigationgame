## Printing instructions

If you prefer to print the "Instruction booklet" and "Reference guide" as spreads, those files are included in /print. For printing as pages instead, see the folders included in /print/optional-formats.

The "Reference guide" is the first two spreads of the "png-covers" file. The "Instruction booklet" is the third spread of the "png-covers" file and has its contents in the "png-booklet" file.

The /print/test-print folder contains duplicates of files "png-board.pdf" and "png-box.pdf" because it is intended to display the complete test print set to avoid confusion.
