  <h1>F.A.Q.</h1>
  <h2>Why should I play it?</h2>
  <p>Project Navigation Game is a game which helps to uncover problems in your project, which you didnâ€™t know you had!
  Is covers all project areas: budget, scope, objectives, people, organisation, practical arrangement and more.
  The game also helps to build up the team.
  </p>
  <h2>What value does playing it bring?</h2>
  <p>The value partly depends in part on what is uncovered during the game.
    From real life examples, the value can be as large as a couple of weeks of time from the entire team.
    In any case Project Navigation Game will increase understanding, project ownership and trust within the team.</p>
  <h2>How much time do I need to play PNG?</h2>
  <p>About 1.5 - 2 hours</p>
  <h2>Who should participate?</h2>
  <p>The entire team. This is anybody who works on the project on a daily bases and is hands on.</p>
  <h2>When to play?</h2>
  <p>The game has the most impact when it is played 1-3 weeks after the start of the project. It continues to be valuable as a retro activity every 3-6 months. It loses impact towards the end of the project (if there is less than 3 months to go)
