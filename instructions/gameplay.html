    <h2>Play a round</h2>
    <p>
        The player who’s turn it is pick the card from his had which is most relevant to the project.
        Use 3 minutes to discuss the card. the aim is not to answer the question but to find out if these is something
        which has not been discussed, if there are risks or if we need to share information within the team.

    </p>
    <p>
        After the 3 minutes are up. The player, with agreement from the team, puts the card in one of the 4 zones: ‘no
        worries, do something!, attention or red alert!’ (see separate card)

    </p>
    <p>
        The player picks blindly a new card from the deck. Optionally the player can discard any cards from his hand and
        replace them with new card picked blindly from the deck.
        The turn goes to the player on the left.
