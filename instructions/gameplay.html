        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>
            Split the deck of question cards (green) into as many decks as there are players. Each player gets one deck.<br>
            Each player selects from the deck the best card he/she can find within one minute and passes the deck to the
            player on his/her left. <br>
            Repeat until each player has seven cards.
        </p>

        <p>The player who most recently joined Futurice starts the first round.</p>

        <h2>Taking your turn</h2>
        <p>Choose a card from your hand which you consider most relevant to the project.</p>
        <p>Take 3 minutes to discuss the card with the group. The aim is not to answer the question but to find out if it is something
        which has not been discussed before, if there are risks or if more information needs to be shared within the team.</p>
        <p>When the 3 minutes are up, with agreement from the team, place the card in one of the 4 zones on the board: "No worries", "Do something", "Attention" or "Red alert" (see zone board section).</p>
        <p>Pick blindly a new card from the deck. Optionally you can discard any cards from your hand and replace them with new cards picked blindly from the deck. The turn goes to the player on the left.</p>
        <p>When each player has played their turn, the round ends.</p>

        <h1>Zones board</h1>
        <p>The zones board has 4 zones. Each card that is discussed is placed in the most severe zone that is applicable to the card. Note that a red alert card could still have actions etc.</p>

        <h2 class="zone">Red alert!</h2>
        <p class="zone">
            A major risk or problem has been identified which threatens the success of the project and the
            team cannot solve this without outside help. For each "red alert" note down who to inform about what.
        </p>

        <h2 class="zone">Attention!</h2>
        <p class="zone">Something has been identified which is going to remain a risk throughout the project. An eye
            needs to be kept on this. For each "attention" note down who should ask what question how often.
        </p>

        <h2 class="zone">Do something!</h2>
        <p class="zone">Something has been identified which requires a
            one-time action. This could be related to getting
            information, a meeting to make a decision etc. For each "do something" note down who should de what when.
        </p>

        <h2 class="zone">No Worries!</h2>
        <p class="zone">The discussion didnâ€™t reveal any risk or any
            important unanswered question. No need to take action.

        <h2>End of the round</h2>

        <p>Each player selects the best card played during that round. Multiple players can select the same card</p>

        <p>The player who played the card which got picked most wins the round. </p>

        <p>The winner of the round selects a golden card without revealing it. This will be done at the end.</p>

        <h2>End of the game</h2>

        <p>The game ends when the time is up. When the time is almost up, complete the last round.
        The players with a golden card read them out now.
        The player with the most golden cards wins.
        List all the agreed actions etc. and agree a follow-up session. </p>
