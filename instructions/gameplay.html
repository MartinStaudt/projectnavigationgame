    <p>
        Split the deck of question cards (green) into as many decks as there are players. Each player gets one deck.<br>
        Each player selects from the deck the best card he/she can find within one minute and passes the deck to the
        player on his/her left. <br>
        Repeat until each player has seven cards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The player who most recently joined Futurice starts the first round.

    <h2>Play a round</h2>
    <p>
        The player who’s turn it is picks the card from his had which is most relevant to the project.</p>
        <p>Use 3 minutes to discuss the card. The aim is not to answer the question but to find out if these is something
        which has not been discussed, if there are risks or if we need to share information within the team.

    </p>
    <p>
        After the 3 minutes are up. The player, with agreement from the team, puts the card in one of the 4 zones: ‘no
        worries, do something!, attention or red alert!’ (see separate card)

    </p>
    <p>
        The player picks blindly a new card from the deck. Optionally the player can discard any cards from his hand and
        replace them with new card picked blindly from the deck.
        The turn goes to the player on the left.

    </p>
    <h2 class="zone">Do something! </h2>

    <h2 class="zone">No Worries.</h2>
    <p class="zone">The discussion didn’t reveal any risk or any
